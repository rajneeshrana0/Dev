        <h1>Promise and Async Await</h1>
        <p>Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations. Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They provide a cleaner syntax for handling asynchronous operations compared to using callbacks.</p>
        <p>Async Await is a syntax that allows us to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. It is a modern JavaScript feature that provides a more readable and synchronous-looking way to write asynchronous code.</p>
        <p>Async Await is built on top of Promises and provides a more concise syntax for handling asynchronous operations. It allows us to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code, making it easier to read and understand.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of using Async Await to handle asynchronous operations:</p>
